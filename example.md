## Installation Instructions
You can install this program by cloning it to your local machine by running git clone. After you successfully clone it to your local machine, you can remove the existing README.md and run node index.js in your terminal. Inquirer is required for this program so be sure to install in using npm i inquirer.
## Usage Information
After the program has been installed, run it by typing node index.js into your terminal. You will be prompted with a series of questions about your program and the content of your markdown file. After the final question is answered, the program will write a new file called README.md. You may then edit your README.md and style it to your liking.
